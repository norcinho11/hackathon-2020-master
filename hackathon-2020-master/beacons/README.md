# beacons
Script for enabling BLE beacon function on RPI. All you need to do:

	1. Copy files from usb to Desktop (setup*, rc.local)
	2. Open terminal
	3. cd /Desktop
	4. bash setup.sh 

Later if you want to dynamicaly change UUID:

	1. Open terminal
	2. bash setupBeacon.sh
	3. RPI will dynamically change self beacon UID after start.

Enjoy :)
